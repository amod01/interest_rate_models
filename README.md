# Interest Rate Models Project

This project implements various interest rate models and uses Monte Carlo simulation to calculate bond prices based on these models. The models included in the project are:

- **Vasicek Model**
- **Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) Model**
- **Hull-White Model**
- **Black-Derman-Toy (BDT) Model**
- **Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) Model**
- **Ho-Lee Model**

The project is written in C++ and demonstrates the simulation of bond prices using different interest rate models with Monte Carlo methods.

## Features

- Implemented interest rate models including Vasicek, CIR, Hull-White, BDT, HJM, and Ho-Lee models.
- Simulated bond prices using Monte Carlo simulations.
- Calculated average bond price based on multiple simulated paths.
- Customizable parameters for each model to adapt to different market conditions.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this project, you need:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher (e.g., GCC, Clang).
- Standard C++ libraries.
